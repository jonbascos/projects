            <h2>About Patrick Marleau</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Marleau">Patrick Marleau</a> is a Canadian born hockey player who was drafted by the <a href="http://www.sjsharks.com">San Jose Sharks</a> in 1997 as the number 2 pick in the NHL Draft right after number 1 pick, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Thornton">Joe Thornton</a> .  Marleau served as the team captain from 2004 to 2009.  Patrick Marleau was the youngest player to ever start in the NHL since his birthday landed at the cut-off date.  Marleau had played for the San Jose Sharks for a total of 19 seasons before he decided to test out the Free Agency market in 2017.  
            </p>
            <p>
                He signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2017 and he is currently waiting to <em>hopefully</em> get signed with the San Jose Sharks again to finish his career and <em>hopefully</em> with a Stanley Cup!
